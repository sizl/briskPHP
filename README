 * STEP 1. SETUP APACHE
 ***********************************************************/

1.) In your Apache vhost config file, configure the path to your document root:

example: "DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite/modules/website/public/"

2.) Set some environment variables

SetEnv ENV_MODE dev
SetEnv ROOT_PATH /var/www/mysite/
SetEnv MODULE website

ENV_MODE is used to determine "prod" or "dev"
ROOT_PATH is used by the framework to setup the include paths
MODULE is the module that the vhost is pointing to

For example, if you set up a mobile module in:
/var/www/mysite/modules/mobile, you would set MODULE to "mobile".

The module name must match the directory!
