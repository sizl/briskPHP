/**********************************************************
 * ABOUT briskPHP
 ***********************************************************/
briskPHP is a simple PHP MVC framework designed to handle static web sites. It is intended to be extremely light weight and easy to set up. It does not have robust functionality like database or session handling. 

/**********************************************************
 * STEP 1. COPY FILES TO SERVER
 ***********************************************************/
1.) Create a fork and clone this repo to your web server or download and copy files to your web server if you do not plan to contribute back to briskPHP.


/**********************************************************
 * STEP 2. SETUP APACHE
 ***********************************************************/

1.) In your Apache vhost config, set the path to your document root:

example: "DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite/modules/website/public/"

2.) Set environment variables

SetEnv ENV_MODE dev
SetEnv ROOT_PATH /var/www/mysite/
SetEnv MODULE website

ENV_MODE : Used to determine "prod" or "dev"
ROOT_PATH : Used by the framework to setup the include paths based on the project root
MODULE : Module that the vhost is pointing to. For example, if you set up a mobile module in: /var/www/mysite/modules/mobile, you would set MODULE to "mobile". ** IMPORTANT ** The module name must match the directory!

/**********************************************************
 * STEP 3. USING briskPHP
 ***********************************************************/
briskPHP is very similar to Zend Framework's MVC. If you are not familiar with MVC patterns please read up before continuing.
